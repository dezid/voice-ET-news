<h2>4. How we use your personal data</h2>
<p>We will only use your personal data within the confines of existing data protection and privacy 
    laws. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances: </p>

   <li> Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into 
    with you. </li>
    <li> Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your 
    interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li> 
   <li>  Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation. </li>
   <li>For further processing to help us make targeted offerings to you</li>
<p>You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us. </p>
<h2>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</h2>
<h2>Promotional offers from us</h2>
   <p> We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what 
    we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which 
    products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). </p>
    
    <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us 
    or purchased goods or services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving 
    that marketing.</p>
    <h2>Opting out</h2>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by contacting 
    us at any time. </p>
    <p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data 
        provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service 
        experience or other transactions. </p>
        <h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites 
    set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website 
    may become inaccessible or not function properly. </p>
    <h2>Change of purpose</h2>
    <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we 
        reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with 
        the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new 
        purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. </p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will 
    explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>
    <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in 
        compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law. </p>
<h2>5. Disclosures of your personal data</h2>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out 
    in the paragraph above. </p>
    <li>External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary. </li>
        
        <li> Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or 
        our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If 
        a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the 
        same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>

        <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in 
            accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal 
            data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified 
            purposes and in accordance with our instructions. </p>

            <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
               <p> Some of our external third parties are based outside the East African Community Area (EAC) so 
                their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EAC. </p>

<h2>7. Data security</h2>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being 
    accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we 
    limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties 
    who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions 
    and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
    <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify 
        you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<h2>8. Data retention</h2>
<p>How long will you use my personal data for? </p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected 
    it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. </p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, 
    and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or 
    disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and 
    whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal 
    requirements.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be 
        associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this 
        information indefinitely without further notice to you. 
        </p>
        <h2>9. Your legal rights</h2>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your 
            personal data.</p>
            <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out below, please contact us. </p>
            <p>You have the right to: </p>
            <p><b>Request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). 
                This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we 
                are lawfully processing it. </p>
<p><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any 
    incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the 
    accuracy of the new data you provide to us. </p>

<p><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal 
    data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask 
    us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to 
    object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or 
    where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that 
    we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons 
    which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

<p><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or 
    those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you 
    want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and 
    freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct 
    marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate 
    grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. </p>
<p><b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend 
    the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the 
    data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) 
    where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, 
    exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to 
    verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it</p>
    <p><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or 
        a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machinereadable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially 
        provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><b>Withdraw consent</b> at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. 
    However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or 
    services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. </p>
    <p><b>No fee usually required</b>
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other 
        rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive 
        or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances</p>
<p><b>What we may need from you</b>
    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and 
    ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a 
    security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to 
    receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request 
    to speed up our response.</p>
<p><b>Time limit to respond</b>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer 
    than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In 
    this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
